#  Predicting Patent Success: A Machine Learning Approach to Commercialization Prospects

This the second project for the [Machine learning Course](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/machine-learning-cs-433/) at EPFL. The project has been done in collaboration with [STIP – Chair of Science Technology and Innovation Policy](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/stip/). 

##  Task description
Understanding the potential commercial success of patents is vital for research institutions, inventors, and industry stakeholders. This documentation delves into the intersection of machine learning techniques and patent commercialization, presenting a tool designed to forecast the likelihood of a patent's success.

In our pursuit of this goal, we provide a comprehensive examination of the underlying framework and share valuable insights into the essential information required for accurate predictions. By leveraging this methodology, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.927 and an F1-score of 0.927.
