clean data: 
* handle missing values 
* normalize data
* numerical encoding of the categorical features
* bag of words for text

implement baseline model. It should be simple just to have.. a baseline
* logistic regression (the simplest for classification)
* Neural net with two layers
* Naive bayes

More fancy cleaning and models
* experiment with different words embeding (TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe))
* neureal net and hyperparameter tuning 

Use large language model for the text
* prepare the data for the task (word embedding..)
* BERT, RoBERTa, GPT..
